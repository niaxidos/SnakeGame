# Snake Game
Welcome to my Snake Game, my very first 2D Unity Project! This is a recreation of the classic Snake game.

For this project, I followed [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/U8gUnpeaMbQ?si=lS1HzB1s8NcujiIY) by Zigurous but added my own features.

## How to Play
- Choose between the three different difficulties (easy, normal and expert).
- Use WASD to control the snake's movement.
- Gather the red food to score points and grow your snake.
- The game ends when you collide with either the wall or yourself.

## Future Features
These are features I plan on adding in the future.
- Power-Ups: Adding special items which grant beneficial abilities, such as invincibility or shrinking the snake.
- Custom Skins: Adding unlockable skins to customize the snake. Skins can be unlocked when reaching certain high score thresholds.
